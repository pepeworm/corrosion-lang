# Get Started with Corrosion

---

&nbsp;

## Overview

Corrosion is a language yada yada yada

&nbsp;

To get started with corrosion, you should install the erosion compiler at [the official repo](/docs/installation/),
the only problem being the compiler currently doesn't work. So, if you want to actually try it out, please wait till
we stop procrastinating and get it finished.

&nbsp;

> Please **don't** download the uncompleted version.

> Another one (DJ khaled reference??)

&nbsp;

## Demonstration

The basic syntax, once completed, should look like this

```
if (wtv) {
	return wtv;
}
```
